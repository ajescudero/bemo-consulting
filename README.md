# Bemo Challenge

A) Create a duplicate of this sister website of ours (http://cdainterview.com/).
B) Of course it is completely OK to copy and paste the images, text, and other
resources from the existing site, but the back-end should be using your own code
(more details about the user-friendly backend below).

C) Your duplicated website should only include the home page and the contact us
page – other pages are not required.

D) Please make sure to make the following easy accessible by a non-developer user in
the panel section (user-friendly back-end) of the site for the two pages of the mock
website:

a. Easy way to change images
b. A simple switch to turn any page to “No-index” so it’s not crawled by
search engines
c. Easy to change text
d. Easy to style text (bold, italics, strikethrough, create links, center text, and
turn text to H1, H2, H3)
e. Include a space for each page to include meta title and meta description
f. Include a space in the panel to include Facebook advertising pixel and a
separate section to include Google analytics tag – these should be global –
i.e. including the code, will integrate the tags across all existing and future
pages. (We will later test these by including our actual tags in the area you
indicate in the panel to make sure they are functional – if you are not
familiar with these tags a quick Internet search should result in sample codes and explanation about these codes by Google and Facebook
themselves.)
g. Create a space in the panel for the contact form to link any email address
to the contact form as we will be testing the functionality.
E) Host the website on a mock server and mock domain of your choice.
F) Please make sure the two pages you are duplicating are set to “No index”.

G) Please indicate the login and password to the website panel section for this site in
your email back to us.

H) Please make sure the website itself is also password protected – please include
URL and login details in your response.

I) The website must be mobile responsive.

J) The website should score 80 or above for both mobile and desktop using Google
PageSpeed tool.
K) Please record the time it took you to complete this task and indicate the time in
your email back to us.

L) Lastly, send us your code in a zip file as an attachment in your email or upload it
on a GitHub account and send us the link in your email.
